The author of this hand-in is Lennart Jung.

The three exercises are solved in three different modules (p1, p2, p3).
Therefore, only one ZIP File is necessary.
For every module a separate UML overview was created.
The png of the overview can be found in the according module folder.

The question in part 3 is answered in the item class in the beginning.

As a VCS GitHub was used. The repository is public and can be cloned under the following URL:
https://github.com/19lenny/A2.git

The code is directly documented in the according classes, methods, variables.
If there are questions open concerning the comments or the code structure feel free to contact me.

All the main classes are built the way that the main content of the according exercise can be reviewed and checked.
